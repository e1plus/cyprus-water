# Cyprus Water Levels Dashboard

A real-time dashboard monitoring water reservoir levels in Cyprus. This project visualizes data regarding dam capacities, daily inflows, and historical trends to provide a clear picture of the island's water security.

## Features

- **Real-time Stats**: View current total capacity percentage and current storage in MCM (Million Cubic Meters).
- **Historical Trends**: Interactive charts showing water storage levels over time.
- **Daily Analysis**: Track daily inflows for the current month.
- **Comparative Data**: Compare monthly inflows across the last 6 years to understand seasonal patterns.
- **Dam Breakdown**: Detailed storage information for individual major dams.

## Technologies

- **HTML5 / JavaScript**: Core structure and logic.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For modern, responsive styling.
- **Chart.js**: For interactive and responsive data visualization.
